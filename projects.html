This course was designed to be an introduction to the basics of programming in "<i>Python</i>" by building simple interactive applications. The primary method for learning the course material was to work through multiple "mini-projects" in "<i>Python</i>". These projects included building games such as "Pong", "Blackjack", and "Asteroids". <u>Attention</u>: a browser-based programming environment "<i>CodeSkulptor</i>" was developed that made developing interactive applications in "<i>Python</i>" simple (<a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/" target="_blank">http://www.codeskulptor.org/</a>). "<i>CodeSkulptor</i>" runs "<i>Python</i>" programs in the browser by clicking the upper left button. It runs in "<i>Chrome 18+</i>", "<i>Firefox 11+</i>", and "<i>Safari 6+</i>". Some features may work in other browsers, but full functionality should not be expected. It does NOT run in "<i>Internet Explorer</i>".</p>

This course explored how to build web applications with the "<i>Ruby on Rails</i>" web application framework starting with the basics of the "<i>Ruby</i>" programming language and continued with more advanced topics, exploring also "object oriented" programming in "<i>Ruby</i>", and demonstrating how to perform "unit testing". Core concepts behind "<i>Ruby on Rails</i>", such as "<i>CoC</i>" (Convention Over Configuration) and "<i>MVC</i>" (Model-View-Controller) were introduced. The version control system called "<i>Git</i>" was presented as well that was used to deploy that "<i>Ruby on Rails</i>" application to "<i>Heroku</i>".</p>

                        	<u>Attention</u>: The Applets start automatically (after few seconds). If they do not work properly, please consult the following notes, which illustrate guidelines on how to overcome possible "Applet Run-Time Exceptions": The projects have been implemented in Java. Due to <i>Java's SunBox</i> restrictions, the execution of an applet can be interrupted by run-time exceptions, e.g. during the construction of dialog boxes or accessing local files. In order to overcome such problems, a nice way is the four steps that follow.
							<ul>
  								<li>Download the <i>Java Run-time Environment (JRE)</i> from Sun's web site <a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_self">http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a></li>
								<li>Install <i>JRE</i> on your computer. JRE comes with a <i>Java Plug-in</i>.</li>
								<li>In case of error starting applet such as the following one: <i>Application Blocked by Security Settings</i>, open <i>Java Control Panel</i> and adjust <i>Security</i> levels or "just" add <i>http://aristotelis-metsinis.github.io/</i> in <i>Exception Site List</i> allowing applet to run after the appropriate security prompt. For more information, please have a look at <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/win_controlpanel.xml" target="_self">http://www.java.com/en/download/help/win_controlpanel.xml</a> and <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml" target="_self">http://www.java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml</a> </li>
  								<li>In case of "IO security" exceptions (e.g. <i>read</i> permission) and assuming that you like to "load" a file that resides under your "home" directory, make use of the <i>policytool</i> application program, which can be found in JRE's <i>/bin/</i> directory. Based on the "default" <i>java.security</i> configuration, which can be found in JRE's <i>/lib/security/</i> directory, you may have to edit two "policy" files, one called <i>java.policy</i> and can be found in JRE's <i>/lib/security/</i> directory (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\lib\security\java.policy") and the other called <i>.java.policy</i> and resides under the <i>/user.home/</i> directory (e.g. "C:\Users\user.home\.java.policy"). So, use <i>policytool</i> to edit both of these files. Specifically, highlight the existing <i>CodeBase &lt;ALL&gt;</i> "policy" entry and press <i>Edit Policy Entry</i> button. A "dialog" box will be displayed. Press <i>Add Permission</i> button. Choose <i>FilePermission</i> (java.io.FilePermission), <i>ALL FILES</i> as the <i>TargetName</i> and <i>read</i> in the <i>Actions</i> field. In this way, applet will (hopefully) overcome any "IO security" exceptions. Press "OK" and "Done" buttons and "save" policy file. Note: you may have to run <i>policytool</i> as "administrator" in order to edit and save properly the "\lib\security\java.policy" file.</li>
                                <li>Restart applet. The HTML source code of the applet's web page will invoke automatically the Java plug-in, overcoming the security exceptions.</li> 
                         	</ul>
