							A data analysis project that completed using "<i>R/RStudio</i>", designed to help us discover and explore a research question, using real data and statistical methods taught in "<i>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference</i>" on-line class offered by "<i>Coursera</i>" (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics" target="_blank">https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics</a> | February - April 2014).
							<br>&nbsp;<br>
							This course introduced the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analysing data; learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty, i.e. how to collect data, how to analyse data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena.
							<br>&nbsp;<br>
							One of the course goals was to complete a research project that employed simple statistical inference and modelling techniques. Particularly, the scope of the data analysis project was writing a research paper addressing a research question that could be answered using a hypothesis test and/or confidence interval, working with one numerical or one categorical variable, or evaluating the relationship between a categorical and a numerical or two categorical variables and finally using a dataset of our own choosing, or one of the datasets curated by the "<i>Duke Data and GIS Library</i>", the "<i>General Social Survey</i>" (GSS) or "<i>American National Election Survey</i>" (ANES). The dataset uploaded onto "<i>R/RStudio</i>". The project paper was written using a "<i>markdown</i>" template, so that all "<i>R</i>" code, output, and plots were automatically included in our write up and exported as a "<i>pdf</i>" file; the one that can be found at the web address of the following link:
